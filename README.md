# Define version control
Version control is a system that allows software developers, designers, and other collaborators to manage and track changes to a project's source code, documents, and other files over time.
# What do you understand by Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows developers to work on a project locally and then share their changes with others. It tracks changes to files over time, so you can easily see who made what changes and when. Git also makes it easy to collaborate with others by allowing multiple developers to work on the same files at the same time without the risk of overwriting each other's changes.
